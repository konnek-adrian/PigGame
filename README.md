# PigGame

Simple game for 2 players on one web browser (PC or laptop preffered)

RULES :

Player 1 starts the game by clicking ROLL DICE button. The object is to get GLOBAL SCORE (the bigger one) to 50 or over. Players are rolling the dice and the results are summing up in the CURRENT window unless a player rolls a 1, which ends turn and reset the current score to 0, then there is a switch and player 2 can roll the dice. The only way to save a score is to hit HOLD button which saves current score and adds it to the global one but it ends player turn as well.

HAVE FUN !
